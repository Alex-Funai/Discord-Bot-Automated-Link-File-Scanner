# <u> Discord-Bot-Automated-Link-File-Scanner: </u> 



## Description:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Discord-Bot-Automated-Link-File-Scanner, is a bot that checks the integrity of urls and file attachments, that are sent through the server. The objects are parsed through VirusTotal.com's database, and the domain, hash, or attachment is compared to VirusTotal's database -- which references over 100+ threat hunt and analyses organizations such as: AlienVault and CINSArmy. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Discord-Bot-Automated-Link-File-Scanner works by utilizing Discord4j to create filtered listening lists, that reference Discord API data, and is trigger when it detects a message body containing a URL/URI verified (apache.commons) link, or if the message's attachments data value !=0.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Once Discord-Bot-Automated-Link-File-Scanner detects a link or URL, it deletes the initial user's message, to protect server members from phishing attempts, or malicious links, and very quickly ( time =< 1s) creates an embedded message with:
+ A link to the integrity report (the title is clickable)
+ A link to the original scanned object.
+ The original users comment/messsage accompanying the object.
+ Relevant data to the scan such as: flags thrown and hashes.
+ Embed accent color for integrity, if the object appears unknown (grey/black), safe (green), or risky (red).

## Abstract:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The idea came from visiting a public crypto discord server. I had posted a link to a book I was reading on chart analyses and trading strategies, and instantly a causcious user yelled "DO NOT CLICK THE LINK", which makes sense from a security perspective, because there could be malware creating backdoor and loggers to siphon crypto wallets, and that's a reasonable precaution. However I was just trying to spread the knowledge. I posted my virustotal scan, and realized that it would be nice possibly for large public servers (especially those over 20,000 members) to have this process automated to protect their server members from the pervasive threats of script kiddies and phishing.
